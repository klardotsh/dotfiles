## ELinks 0.13.GIT configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so, but keep in mind that this file is overwritten
## by ELinks when you save options through UI and you are out of
## luck with your formatting and own comments then, so beware.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

    #  disabled all folders will appear unexpanded next time ELinks is run.

#  Configuration handling options.

    #  Amount of comments automatically written to the config file:
    #  0 is no comments are written

    #  3 is full comments are written

    #  2 is the configuration file is rewritten from scratch

    #  files. Note you must define both a MIME handler and a MIME type
    #  association for it to work.

    #  Document browsing options (mainly interactivity).

        #  Options for handling of images.

    #  Rules for passing URIs to external commands. When one rule is defined the
    #  link and tab menu will have a menu item that makes it possible to pass
    #  the the link, frame or tab URI to an external command. If several rules
    #  are defined the link and tab menu will have a submenu of items for each
    #  rule.
    #  
    #  Note, this is mostly useful for launching graphical viewers, since there
    #  is no support for releasing the terminal while the command runs. The
    #  action and submenus are also available by binding keys to the
    #  frame-external-command, the link-external-command, and the
    #  tab-external-command actions.



#  MIME-related options (handlers of various MIME types).

    #  Extension <-> MIME type association.


    #  A file type handler is a set of information about how to use an external
    #  program to view a file. It is possible to refer to it for several MIME
    #  types -- e.g., you can define an 'image' handler to which
    #  mime.type.image.png, mime.type.image.jpeg, and so on will refer; or one
    #  might define a handler for a more specific type of file -- e.g., PDF
    #  files. Note you must define both a MIME handler and a MIME type
    #  association for it to work.




    #  Handler <-> MIME type association. The first sub-tree is the MIME class
    #  while the second sub-tree is the MIME type (ie. image/gif handler will
    #  reside at mime.type.image.gif). Each MIME type option should contain
    #  (case-sensitive) name of the MIME handler (its properties are stored at
    #  mime.handler.<name>).





#  Protocol specific options.

    #  Rules for rewriting URIs entered in the goto dialog. It makes it possible
    #  to define a set of prefixes that will be expanded if they match a string
    #  entered in the goto dialog. The prefixes can be dumb, meaning that they
    #  work only like URI abbreviations, or smart ones, making it possible to
    #  pass arguments to them like search engine keywords.

        #  Dumb prefixes, see enable-dumb description for details.


        #  Smart prefixes, see enable-smart description for details.



    #  User protocols. Options in this tree specify external handlers for the
    #  appropriate protocols. Ie. protocol.user.mailto.unix.
